## Work Experience
**Research Intern @ fortiss (_Mar. 2023 - Jun. 2023_)**
- Conducted a literature review in object detection, focusing on the YOLO series.
- Analyzed and summarized the path planning pipeline of Autoware.Auto.
- Deployed and configured Autoware.Auto's simulation environment on an embedded device (Nvidia Jetson TX2).


## Projects
### Classify Leaves - Kaggle Competition (_Feb. 2024 - Mar. 2024_)
[Kaggle NoteBook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaichengni/leaves-classification)

- Completed a project (Kaggle) on classifying 176 categories of 26000 leaf images using a pre-trained deep learning model in PyTorch, achieving an mAP of 98.13% (Top 20 in the leaderboard).
- Enhanced model mAP by around 1% through data augmentation techniques(MixUp and CutMix).


### Modeling and Control of Legged Robots (_Jun. 2023 - Sept. 2023_)

Project at Institute for Cognitive Systems (ICS), Technical University of Munich (TUM)
- Enabled Legged Robot(Talos) standing on one leg, squats, and walking in the PyBullet simulator.
- Implemented real-time 3D body pose estimation (using ROS4HRI based on Google MediaPipe) and the teleoperation between human and robot.

- Conducted 4-class car damage classification using transfer learning (ResNet-18) in Pytorch.
- Deployed and compared four continual learning strategies(Cumulative, Replay, LWF, and Naive training strategies).
- Managed the project's transition to Docker.
